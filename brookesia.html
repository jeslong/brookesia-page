		<div class="bouncy-columns"><p> Brookesia micra is a species of chameleon from the islet of Nosy Hara in Antsiranana, Madagascar. As of 14 February 2012, it is the smallest known chameleon and among the smallest reptiles, small enough to stand on the head of a match. In length, adult Brookesia micra can grow up to 29 millimetres (1.1 in).
		Brookesia micra, together with three other species, was found in north Madagascar some time between 2003 and 2007. This species was discovered on a small islet off the coast of Madagascar. They typically reside in leaf litter during the day, and climb up into tree branches as high as 10 centimetres (3.9 in) at night to sleep. Brookesia micra live in an area subject to illegal logging, which may make them "sensitive to habitat destruction", according to researcher Jorn Kohler.<br><br>
